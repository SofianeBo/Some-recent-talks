A selection of slides I used recently for some talks.

* SB_DMSO10.pdf: Technical talk at DESY theory workshop about work on dark matter candidates from Grand Unified Theories. Hamburg.
* OKC Colloquium: General colloquium presenting my thoughts on non-supersymmetric dark-matter. Stockholm.

For completeness, I may upload the rest of my talks (~30) here some day ...
